#Naming Conventions

The following naming conventions are to be followed in all code:

    #Class Name

      All words capitalised: ExampleClass
      Method/Object Name

      First word lowercase, second word capitalised: exampleMethod
      Variable Name

    First word lowercase, second word capitalised: exampleVariable
    No abbreviations, so long as variable names are a reasonable length: readIndex NOT rdIdx
    Numbers to be written as words: variableFour NOT variable4

    #Commenting Practice

The following points must be followed when commenting Java code:

    Method descriptions added before a method
    Line descriptions added at the end of a line (where required)

#Other Conventions

The following additional points must be followed in all code:

    Brackets ( { ) appear underneath methods, if statements etc.
    "get” and “set methods to be used for variables
    Magic numbers” to be set at the top of classes, and well commented on their purpose
    boolean methods” that return “true” if successful to be used instead of “void methods”

# Branching Policy

    The master branch must always be a functioning piece of software
    Once a user story test has been satisfied and approved by the Testing Manager and Software Manager, the relevant branch can be merged with the master
    See the development process diagram (NEED NUMBER OF IT) for the full process.

#Backup Procedure

The Software Manager is responsible for carrying out pre and post branch merge backups. These should be stored in folders with timestamp information in the following places:

    Cloud backup service (eg. Google Drive)
    Local storage (eg. a PC hard disk drive)
    Removable storage (eg. a memory stick or portable hard disk)
